## Bugs or Suggestions: 
If you have found a bug, or have a suggestion, please reach out using the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/DailyOtterBot/OtterBotDiscord/issues).

## Troubleshooting:
- Ensure OtterBot has the correct [channel permissions](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ#h_01FFTW0BY5PDYV8YKSAWHJKR3T). It needs to be able to ```View Channel```, ```Send Messages```, and ```Embed Links```.
- Ensure users have access to use slash commands in their [role permissions](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ#h_01FFTVYZ40ZBHKZWTN1N8WPDTG).
- Ensure there aren't issues with Discord or our servers by running ```/ping```. The lower the number the better. If the number is in the thousands, there are likely server errors that will be fixed shortly.
- If you're still having issues, please reach out using the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/DailyOtterBot/OtterBotDiscord/issues).
